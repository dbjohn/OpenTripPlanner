This is my fork of the OpenTripPlanner project at https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner.  
This has been modified to fulfil the role of calculating travel times in a project for my course work.  
The main modifications are found in the opentripplanner-analyst sub-project.  
The other main part of this project is the Ruby on Rails project at 
https://github.com/dbjohn/Property-Recommender-Website, which also contains 
an instructions.txt with more details on the project.
